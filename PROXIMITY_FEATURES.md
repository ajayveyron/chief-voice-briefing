# Proximity Sensor & Audio Routing Features

This document describes the new proximity sensor and audio routing features added to the Chief Voice Briefing app.

## Features Added

### 1. Proximity Detection üîç

- **Automatic Detection**: The app now detects when you hold your phone close to your ear during a call
- **Screen Dimming**: When the phone is near your ear, the screen automatically dims to save battery and prevent accidental touches
- **Visual Indicator**: A green "Near Ear" indicator appears in the header when proximity is detected

### 2. Audio Routing üîä

- **Default Mode**: Calls start in "Earpiece" mode (similar to regular phone calls)
- **Speaker Toggle**: Click the volume button to switch between earpiece and speaker modes
- **Visual Feedback**: The volume button changes color and style based on the current audio route:
  - **Gray gradient**: Earpiece mode
  - **Blue gradient with glow**: Speaker mode
- **Audio Route Indicator**: Shows current mode (Earpiece/Speaker) in the header

## How It Works

### Proximity Detection Methods

The app uses multiple detection methods for better accuracy:

1. **Screen Visibility**: Primary method - detects when screen goes dark
2. **Device Orientation**: Detects when phone is held in portrait mode
3. **Device Motion**: Uses accelerometer to detect stable ear position (when available)
4. **Wake Lock**: Monitors screen wake lock changes

### Audio Routing

- **Earpiece Mode**:
  - Enhanced echo cancellation
  - Noise suppression enabled
  - Lower volume for private conversations
- **Speaker Mode**:
  - Reduced echo cancellation for speaker use
  - Higher volume output
  - Optimized for hands-free use

## User Experience

### During a Call

1. **Start Call**: Audio defaults to earpiece mode
2. **Bring to Ear**: Screen dims automatically, "Near Ear" indicator appears
3. **Switch to Speaker**: Tap the volume button to enable speaker mode
4. **Move Away**: Screen brightens when phone moves away from ear

### Visual Indicators

- **Green dot + "Near Ear"**: Phone is detected near your ear
- **Blue dot + "Speaker"**: Speaker mode is active
- **Gray dot + "Earpiece"**: Earpiece mode is active

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported

- Chrome/Edge on Android
- Safari on iOS
- Firefox on Android

### Partially Supported

- Desktop browsers (proximity detection limited)
- Older mobile browsers

### Required Permissions

- **Microphone**: Required for audio input
- **Device Motion**: Optional, enhances proximity detection
- **Screen Wake Lock**: Optional, improves battery life

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

- `useProximitySensor.ts`: Handles proximity detection
- `useAudioRouting.ts`: Manages audio route switching
- Enhanced `RealtimeVoiceChief.tsx`: Integrates new features

### CSS Classes

- `.proximity-dimmed`: Screen dimming when near ear
- `.proximity-normal`: Normal brightness state
- `.audio-route-earpiece`: Earpiece button styling
- `.audio-route-speaker`: Speaker button styling

## Troubleshooting

### Proximity Detection Not Working

1. Ensure you're using a supported mobile browser
2. Check if device motion permissions are granted
3. Try covering the screen manually to test visibility detection

### Audio Routing Issues

1. Check browser audio permissions
2. Ensure no other apps are using the microphone
3. Test with different audio devices (headphones, etc.)

### Performance Tips

- Close other audio apps while using the voice call feature
- Ensure stable internet connection for best audio quality
- Use in quiet environments for better proximity detection

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Hardware proximity sensor integration (when available)
- Custom proximity sensitivity settings
- Audio quality optimization per route
- Enhanced battery optimization

### Mobile App Version

For full native proximity sensor support, consider the React Native version which provides:

- True hardware proximity sensor access
- Native audio routing controls
- Better battery management
- Enhanced vibration feedback
